We chose Atma for its playful elegance and Nunito Sans for its clean readability‚Äîtogether they create a visually engaging and user-friendly experience that complements the spirit of our quiz app. We used Google Fonts to seamlessly integrate beautiful, high-performance typography‚Äîensuring our quiz looks great across devices with minimal effort.

## AI Reflections  

AI tools were used strategically to assist development:  
- **Code creation:** Supported in generating base functions for quiz logic.  
- **Debugging:** Helped identify merge conflict resolutions and JS logic errors.  
- **Performance & UX:** Suggested optimisations for responsiveness and accessibility.  
- **Workflow:** Improved team efficiency by clarifying tasks and speeding up problem-solving.  

We used AI as a **collaborative assistant**, not as a replacement for our coding. Every team member actively contributed to code, testing, and merging.
